# Weekend Planner - Smart Activity Scheduler

A sophisticated React-based weekend planning application that helps users organize and optimize their leisure time with intelligent features including weather integration, holiday awareness, and smart activity suggestions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19.1.1 with modern hooks and context patterns
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.2 for fast development and optimized builds
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Styling**: CSS Modules with custom properties for theming

### Project Structure

## üéØ Major Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. State Management Architecture

**Decision**: Context API + useReducer instead of Redux

- **Rationale**: For this application's complexity level, React's built-in state management provides sufficient functionality without external dependencies
- **Trade-off**: Sacrificed advanced debugging tools for simplicity and reduced bundle size
- **Implementation**: `EnhancedWeekendContext` manages complex state with actions pattern similar to Redux

### 2. Component Design Philosophy

**Decision**: Feature-based component organization with strict separation of concerns

- **Layout Components**: Handle positioning and visual structure
- **Feature Components**: Encapsulate specific functionality (ActivityBrowser, ScheduleView, WeatherIntegration)
- **UI Components**: Reusable, styled primitives (Button, Card)
- **Trade-off**: More files and imports vs. better maintainability and testability

### 3. Data Persistence Strategy

**Decision**: localStorage with automatic save/load

- **Rationale**: Provides instant data persistence without backend complexity
- **Implementation**: Automatic saving on schedule changes with error handling
- **Trade-off**: Limited to single device vs. cross-device synchronization

### 4. Weekend Type Flexibility

**Decision**: Support multiple weekend configurations (Regular, Long, Extended, Custom)

- **Rationale**: Accommodates different work schedules and cultural contexts
- **Implementation**: Dynamic day selection with schedule preservation
- **Benefit**: Increases application relevance for diverse user bases

## üé® Component Design Approach

### 1. Compound Component Pattern

**Benefits**: Clear composition, flexible layouts, easy to test components in isolation

### 2. Render Props & Custom Hooks

**Benefits**: Logic reuse, clean component interfaces, easier testing

### 3. Progressive Enhancement

- **Base functionality**: Works without JavaScript (static HTML/CSS)
- **Enhanced experience**: Smart suggestions, real-time weather
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallbacks for API failures

### 4. Accessibility First

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for modals

## üé≠ State Management Design

### Enhanced Context Pattern

**Key Features**:

- **Immutable updates**: Prevents accidental state mutations
- **Action creators**: Consistent API for state modifications
- **Computed values**: Derived state calculated in provider
- **Automatic persistence**: localStorage integration with error handling
